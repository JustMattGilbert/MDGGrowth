Every single inkhide notebook and leather good is made by hand, using only American made leather and sustainable, archival, paper materials.

## Our Mission.

At inkhide, we think that everyone has their own story. That’s why all of our handbound notebooks, sketchbooks, and journals are unique, just like you. We only use fountain pen friendly, acid-free, FSC certified paper, made right here in America from manufacturers who are committed to sustainability and responsibility. So whether you are writing your grocery lists with a fountain pen, meeting notes with your coworker’s Uniball, or your next novel with a pencil, our notebooks and covers have you…covered.
